#### Overview/Description of Project: TodoApp management. The main purpose of this project is to create a todo application.
#### Details:
#### Technologies used: HTML, CSS/SASS, JavaScript/jQuery
#### Ideas for future improvement:

###### 3. In the future I would like to add more functionality to the project by integrating tables with search, pagination and sorting functionality.
