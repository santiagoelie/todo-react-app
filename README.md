#### Name: Eliezer Santiago
#### Overview/Description of Project: TodoApp management. The main purpose of this project is to create a todo application.
#### Details:
#### Technologies used: HTML, CSS/SASS, JavaScript/jQuery
#### Ideas for future improvement:
###### 1. The Bootstrap grid system was implemented in this project as a time-saving measure. This was a first attempt at creating a web site using Bootstrap. In the future I would like to refine the responsive elements.
###### 2. In addition to improving the future styling and responsive elements on this site, I will be working on refining my JavaScript and jQuery skills for creating web apps.
###### 3. Bootstrap classes accounted for the majority of the styling on the page. I would also like to experiment more with converting Bootstrap classes to SCSS for customization
